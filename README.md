## Zsofia Szonyi

I'm an aspiring full stack developer, currently studying at Makers Academy, a highly selective coding bootcamp. After 6 years in administration and coming from a science background, I was ready to pursue a new career in software development. I discovered that seeing my coding projects come to life and solving puzzles on the way is one of the most satisfying things.

## Skills

#### Quick self-learner

- Able to learn new technologies rapidly and efficiently. 
- I got into coding through self-learning, and before joining the bootcamp I taught myself a wide range of technologies, in both front-end (React) and back-end (Node.js & MongoDB).

#### Inquisitive
- I love learning & improving, whether it's acquiring technical knowledge, experimenting in the kitchen, or learning a new language. 

#### Attention to detail
- While working with financial data I have developed a keen eye for the details. This directly relates to the coding debugging process and it helps me find the bug.
