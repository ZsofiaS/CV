I studied at Makers Academy, a highly selective developer bootcamp from March to July 2020. I initially taught myself to code, and after 6 years in administration and coming from a science background, I decided to pursue a new career in software development. I found seeing my coding projects come to life very satisfying, and I discovered how much I enjoy the challenges and continuous learning process it involves.  
My goal is to work at a company where I can continue to improve the skillset I developed at Makers, following best practices and processes.
